# Tools and Tecniques for Vulnerability Validation.

The purpose of this repository is to provide DevOps the necesary tools and techniques to validate remediation of vulnerabilities and expedite the process.

it is important to note that a Linux server is used for most of these vulnerabilities, this is because commands like ``grep``, ``sed``, etc. work differently in OSX, in that case the GNU version can be installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) but results can be different.

## Vulnerabilities

* [38140 - SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability](https://github.com/apuentemedallia/tools-and-techniques-for-vulnerability-validation/blob/master/38140%20-%20SSL%20Server%20Supports%20Weak%20Encryption%20Vulnerability.md)
* [42430 - OpenSSL Memory Leak Vulnerability (Heartbleed Bug)](aa)

## Tools

* **[sslyze_cli.py](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze)** Fast and full-featured SSL scanner for Python 2.7. SSLyze is a Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it.
